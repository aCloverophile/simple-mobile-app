## GitHub Clone App
ðŸ’› As the homework project for the "Mobile Programming and Security" course, I created a simple mobile application written in Kotlin. 

---

Called the "GitHub Clone App", this project aimed to sharpen our skills in...
- working with API calls and requests,
- using RecyclerView for UI design,
- understanding how a mobile application works overall.

The video below shows the overall functionalities of the application:

Note: the application itself was developed and intended for the homework lab. So it is normal that its UI is imperfect and some functionalities can be written much more efficiently.
